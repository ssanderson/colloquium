Title: Hilbert's Nullstellensatz: An Introduction to Algebraic Geometry

Abstract: Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, or “Theorem of Zeros”, is a
foundational result in the field of algebraic geometry.  In its weak
form, it states that a set of polynomials in n variables over an
algebraically-closed field K share a zero if and only if they do not
generate the unit ideal in K[X_1, X_2, … X_n].  More generally, the
Nullstellensatz relates the affine variety associated with a set S of
polynomials in K[X_1, … X_n] to the radical of the ideal generated by
S.  In this talk, we give an introduction to the concepts necessary
for understanding this important result and present a proof of the
equivalence of the strong and weak versions.
